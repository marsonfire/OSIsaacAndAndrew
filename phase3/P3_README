Status of Files:
initProc.c    - Compiles and is currently in the debugging stage, something wrong with the individual uproc initialization.
pager.c       - Currently in process of being written.
sysSupport    - Compiles and is currently in the debugging stage.
test files    - All written and should be running correctly.

Currently, the machine will run and output system halted in terminal 0, more than likely due to some fault 
in the user process initialization. We get to our debug(2) marker in initProc.c before the system crashes. 
The next file to work on once initProc would be done is the pager file to handle any page faults in the
system.
