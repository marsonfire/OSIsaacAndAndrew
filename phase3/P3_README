Status of Files/methods:

initProc.c - Compiles and is currently in the debugging stage
 - test: Where we got stuck... we can't get past setting the asid of
   	 the user process. Have tried lots of things but it always crashes
	 there and we never are able to reach debug(2) in the code.

 - uProcInit: Written and compiles, but haven't done any debugging because
   	      setting up our user process in test() was crashing

 - TapeRead: Written and compiles, but haven't done any debugging because
   	     setting up our user process in test() was crashing

 - DiskOperation: Not completely written, but compiles. Haven't done any
   		  debugging because our user process in test() is crashing

Pager - Not written, we were focusing on finishing initProc.c and sysSupport.c
      	and didn't write this.

Phase 3 sys handler - Compiles and is currently in the debugging stage.
      	    	      Syscalls 10 and 17 have been written and compile. Sys10
		      only attempts to work with Terminal0 at the moment

Currently, the machine will run and output system halted in terminal 0, more
than likely due to some fault in the user process initialization. We get
to our debug(1) marker in initProc.c and then the system crashes when setting
the user process' asid.
